# Purplei-HD
High‑Dimensional, context‑aware audio protocol for AR/VR — defining stance, phase, geometry, emotional color, and identity as a new sensory layer.

### High‑Dimensional Context‑Aware Audio Protocol  
### By Brandon Lee Frost

Purplei‑HD is a sensory protocol that introduces **context‑aware audio** to AR, VR, mobile, and spatial computing systems.  
It defines how sound should respond to **stance, phase, geometry, emotional color, identity, and spatial orientation** in real time.

This repository contains the **official specification**, **standards proposal**, and **reference engine architecture** for Purplei‑HD.

## 🌐 What Is Purplei‑HD?

Purplei‑HD is the world’s first **High‑Dimensional Sound Layer** — a protocol that transforms audio from a passive signal into an **adaptive, meaningful, context‑driven system**.

It does not replace audio codecs.  
It wraps them in **context metadata** that allows sound to:

- shift with user stance  
- adapt to emotional state  
- follow symbolic geometry  
- transition through ritual phases  
- carry identity signatures  
- respond to spatial orientation  

Purplei‑HD is a **new sensory layer** for the spatial era.

## 🧩 Core Components

### **1. Metadata Schema**
Defines fields for:
- `stance.mode`
- `phase.state`
- `geometry.symbol`
- `affect.color`
- `identity.signature`
- `space.orientation`

### **2. Interpretation Engine**
Rules for how metadata transforms audio in real time.

### **3. Transformation Layers**
- stance‑aware EQ  
- phase‑aware transitions  
- geometry‑driven spatialization  
- emotional color modulation  
- identity imprinting  

### **4. Compliance Levels**
Three tiers of Purplei‑HD compatibility:
- Level 1: Metadata Support  
- Level 2: Adaptive Engine  
- Level 3: Full Protocol Implementation

## 🎧 EchoFlow — Reference Implementation

EchoFlow is the official **reference engine** for Purplei‑HD.

It demonstrates:
- real‑time context interpretation  
- emotional color mapping  
- geometry‑based spatialization  
- identity‑encoded sound  
- ritual‑phase sequencing  

EchoFlow shows how Purplei‑HD behaves in a real system.
